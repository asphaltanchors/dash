# AAC Dashboard

A modern business intelligence dashboard for QuickBooks data visualization and analysis.

## Features

- üë• Customer relationship management
- üè¢ Company data enrichment
- üìà Order tracking and analysis
- üì± Responsive design with Shadcn UI

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Update DATABASE_URL and other required variables
```

3. Run database migrations:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

I do a weird thing with a postgres view that you need to manually create. Migations don't seem to currently (2025-01) handle views well.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public."CompanyStats"
 AS
 SELECT c.id,
    count(DISTINCT cust.id) AS "customerCount",
    COALESCE(sum(o."totalAmount"), 0::numeric) AS "totalOrders"
   FROM "Company" c
     LEFT JOIN "Customer" cust ON cust."companyDomain" = c.domain
     LEFT JOIN "Order" o ON o."customerId" = cust.id
  GROUP BY c.id;
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.
